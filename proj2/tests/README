Scripts for testing project 2
These will be used for grading the project, but they should be useful
in development too. 

Use the .sh version for Linux and Mac (use chmod +x *.sh first)
Use the .cmd version for Windows
Note that you also need product.json and order.json to run these

Usage:
On topcat: running servertest0.sh to test eoneils proj2_server:
servertest0.sh eoneil

On development PC system, with project at htdocs/cs637/username/proj2/proj2_server:
servertest0 username

servertest series: test proj2_server only
servertest0: tests provided functionality of proj2_server
servertest1: test that server day number can be set, setting of day 0 reinitializes orders
servertest2: setting day 0 to reinit orders, then sending an order in, can get order back as order 1, or possibly a higher number on reruns
servertest3: like servertest2, then set server day to 3, get order back, should be delivered
